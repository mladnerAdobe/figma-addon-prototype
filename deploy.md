# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., `figma-addon-prototype`)
4. Make it **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. **Don't** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Run these in your terminal:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Set the main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

## Step 4: Access Your Live Site
After a few minutes, your site will be available at:
```
https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME/
```
